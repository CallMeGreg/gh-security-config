# GitHub Security Configuration CLI Extension

A GitHub CLI extension to create and apply security configurations across all organizations in a GitHub Enterprise.

> [!NOTE]
> This extension currently only supports configuring GitHub Advanced Security and Secret Scanning features as part of a security configuration.

> [!TIP]
> For GitHub Enterprise Server 3.16+ and GitHub Enterprise Cloud it's recommended to use [Enterprise Security Configurations](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-code-security/securing-your-enterprise/about-security-configurations) instead of this solution.

## Pre-requisites

1. For [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) features, your organizations need appropriate licensing.
2. Install the GitHub CLI: https://github.com/cli/cli#installation
3. Confirm that you are authenticated with an account that has access to the enterprise and organizations you would like to interact with. You can check your authentication status by running:

```
gh auth status
```

Ensure that you have the necessary scopes (`read:enterprise` and `admin:org`). You can add scopes by running:

```
gh auth login -s "read:enterprise,admin:org"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enterprise admins do not inherently have access to all of the organizations in the enterprise. You must ensure that your account has the necessary permissions to access the organizations you want to modify. To elevate your permissions for an organization, refer to these [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.15/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/managing-your-role-in-an-organization-owned-by-your-enterprise).

## Installation

To install this extension, run the following command:
```
gh extension install CallMeGreg/gh-security-config
```

## Usage

### Generate Security Configurations

Run the interactive security configuration generator:

```bash
gh security-config generate
```

To target specific organizations using a CSV file:

```bash
gh security-config generate --org-list path/to/organizations.csv
```

To copy an existing security configuration from another organization:

```bash
gh security-config generate --copy-from-org <ORG_NAME>
```

You can also combine the copy functionality with organization targeting:

```bash
gh security-config generate --copy-from-org <ORG_NAME> --org-list path/to/organizations.csv
```

The extension will guide you through:

1. **Enterprise Setup**: Enter your GitHub Enterprise slug and server URL (if using GitHub Enterprise Server)
2. **Configuration Source**: Choose to either create a new configuration or copy from an existing organization (when using `--copy-from-org`)
3. **Security Configuration**: Define the name, description, and security settings for your configuration (or select from existing configurations when copying)
4. **Repository Scope**: Choose which repositories to apply the configuration to:
   - `all` - All repositories
   - `public` - Public repositories only
   - `private_or_internal` - Private and internal repositories only
5. **Default Setting**: Optionally set the configuration as default for new repositories
6. **Confirmation**: Review and confirm the operation before execution

### Organization Targeting

By default, all commands target every organization in the specified enterprise. You can limit the scope using the `--org-list` flag:

- **CSV Format**: Create a CSV file with one organization name per line (no header row required)
- **Example CSV**: See [example-organizations.csv](example-organizations.csv) for the correct format
- **Error Handling**: If an organization from the CSV is not found or accessible, the tool will show a warning and continue with other organizations

### Copying Security Configurations

The `--copy-from-org` flag allows you to copy an existing security configuration from one organization and apply it to other organizations in your enterprise. This is useful for:

- **Standardizing configurations**: Copy a well-tested configuration across multiple organizations
- **Quick setup**: Avoid recreating similar configurations from scratch
- **Configuration migration**: Move configurations between organizations

#### How it works:

1. **Source Organization Access**: You must be an owner of the source organization to copy configurations
2. **Configuration Selection**: Choose from available security configurations in the source organization
3. **Settings Review**: Review the configuration details that will be copied
4. **Target Filtering**: The source organization is automatically excluded from target organizations to prevent self-copying

> [!NOTE]
> When using `--copy-from-org`, you can still customize the repository attachment scope and default setting for the target organizations, even though the security settings themselves are copied from the source.

### Delete Security Configurations

Run the interactive security configuration deletion:

```bash
gh security-config delete
```

To target specific organizations using a CSV file:

```bash
gh security-config delete --org-list path/to/organizations.csv
```

The extension will guide you through:

1. **Enterprise Setup**: Enter your GitHub Enterprise slug and server URL (if using GitHub Enterprise Server)
2. **Configuration Selection**: Specify the name of the security configuration to delete
3. **Confirmation**: Review the operation summary and confirm deletion (defaults to cancel for safety)

> [!WARNING]
> The delete operation will remove the specified security configuration from ALL organizations in the enterprise. This action cannot be undone. Repositories will retain their security settings but will no longer be associated with the configuration.

### Modify Security Configurations

Run the interactive security configuration modification:

```bash
gh security-config modify
```

To target specific organizations using a CSV file:

```bash
gh security-config modify --org-list path/to/organizations.csv
```

The extension will guide you through:

1. **Enterprise Setup**: Enter your GitHub Enterprise slug and server URL (if using GitHub Enterprise Server)
2. **Configuration Selection**: Specify the name of the security configuration to modify
3. **Current Settings Display**: View the current configuration settings and description
4. **Settings Update**: Interactively update each security setting with options to keep current values
5. **Confirmation**: Review the changes and confirm modification before execution

> [!INFO]
> The modify operation will update the specified security configuration across ALL organizations in the enterprise where it exists. Organizations without the configuration will be skipped.
